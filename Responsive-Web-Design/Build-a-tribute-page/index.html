          which had been certified multi-platinum in several countries, including the US, the UK, and Canada. In 2013,
          he released his debut EP, featuring the single "Take Me to Church". His debut studio album, released in 2014,
          topped the chart in Ireland
          and scored top ten positions on global charts. It has been certified 6× platinum in Ireland and multi-platinum
          in several countries. He embarked on an American and a European tour to support the album. In September 2018,
          Hozier released an EP,
          titled Nina Cried Power, featuring the title track as a single. He released his second album, Wasteland,
          Baby!, in March 2019. It debuted atop the US Billboard 200. He is scheduled to embark on a worldwide tour,
